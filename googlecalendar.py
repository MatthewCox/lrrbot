def _apply_monkey_patch(rrule):
	"""
	The processing in dateutil.rrule is not properly timezone-aware, mostly because
	Python's timezone handling is far from ideal. In particular, it will claim that,
	for instance, a week after "2014-03-06 19:00:00 PST" is "2014-03-13 19:00:00 PST",
	when in fact the correct answer is "2014-03-13 19:00:00 PDT", as daylight savings
	has started.

	Notably, the time from the original time to the time 1 week later is not 7*24 hours
	when calculated correctly.

	We monkey-patch the rrule class so that all the datetimes that come out of it are
	re-localised, so that the naive hour/minute values are preserved, but the DST flag
	is changed. This means that the corrected dates are what is seen by rrule.after(),
	when it does comparisons using the dates, so the correct results should come out.

	This is a hack that messes with the internals of the library, and as such is far
	from a good idea. It was written against dateutil 2.2, and no guarantees that it
	will work with any other version of that library. A better solution would be
	appreciated, even if it means ditching dateutil for a better library that does
	what we want it to here.
